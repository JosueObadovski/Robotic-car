# Robotic-car
This was a robot construction project, in which we used an arduino uno board and c++ language, the robot had the function of detecting the line of an arena and differentiating its colors, to avoid leaving a sensor to detect objects close to a radius of 80cm, in the case of advancing on the opponent and trying to get him out of the arena.
